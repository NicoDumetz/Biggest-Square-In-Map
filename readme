Project Title: Largest Square Finder

Objective:
The objective of this project is to find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles. The program allows two methods of obtaining the board: reading from a file or generating one based on given parameters.

File Input Constraints:

    The file must be passed as an argument to the program.
    The file must adhere to the following constraints:
        The first line contains the number of lines on the board.
        Only '.' (representing an empty place) and 'o' (representing an obstacle) characters are allowed.
        All lines (except the first one) must be of the same length.
        The file must contain at least one line.
        Each line is terminated by '\n'.

Output:
The program prints the board, with some '.' replaced by 'x' to represent the largest square found. If there are multiple solutions, it chooses the highest square. If there are still multiple solutions, it chooses the square to the left.

Generating Your Own Board:
Alternatively, the program can generate a board based on given parameters:

    Width and height of the board.
    A pattern that will be repeated line by line along the board.

Examples:

    Classic Execution (Using File Input):

    shell

$ ./largest_square_finder example_file | cat -e
.....xxxxxxx................$
....oxxxxxxx................$
.....xxxxxxxo...............$
.....xxxxxxx................$
....oxxxxxxx................$
.....xxxxxxx...o............$
.....xxxxxxx................$
......o...............o.....$
..o.......o.................$

Generating Execution:

shell

    $ ./largest_square_finder 6 "..o.." | cat -e
    ..oxx.$
    .o.xx.$
    o....o$
    ....o.$
    ...o..$
    ..o...$

Usage:

    Clone or download the repository.
    Navigate to the directory containing the program.
    Run the program using the command line:
        For file input: ./largest_square_finder path_to_file
        For generating a board: ./largest_square_finder width height pattern
